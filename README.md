# dykes_n_ditches

A repo for the **dykes and ditches** NIAB electronics club project.

Current objective: understand how the arduino water sensor works.

Broadly following this tutorial:
https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-water-sensor

Update: water sensor working and connected to Arduino through the breadboard, alongisde an external LCD (connection schemes/photos to fillow)

Ditches visited (photos to follow).


Extra: integrate with an external LED screen to poutput readings insead of a serial monitor.

Next: turbidity sensor.


Notes: 4 wires sticking out of a sensor is the I2C interface "I squared C".
